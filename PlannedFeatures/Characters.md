## Orange Lightning

I don't have much planned for this class yet.

Daxter will be a lot more nimble than Jak, so I might add more defense to his deck, or chances to avoid attacks, not entirely certain.
I will either do reasearch into the Daxter game, or just play it myself, but I would like to use a lot of ideas from it for this character.
I will also add in some cards based on the times you play as Daxter in Jak 3.
I'm thinking of making an event that can only occur when playing as Daxter where you are supposed to run from the spider, not certain what the options will be.
