# Eco

There are 6 types of Eco:
* Blue
* Green
* Red
* Yellow
* Dark
* Light

Eco will be found in 2 types:
* Orb/cluster form, some way for repeatable gain in high bursts
  * I don't know if I only want to allow 1 eco at a time, like TPL
  * Allowing multiple at a time makes simpler coding and simpler for the player
* Vent form, a continuous gain across turns in low amounts
  * You can only be on 1 vent at a time
  * Balancing will determine if getting off a vent refunds the old vent, or if it's gone for the rest of combat

## Dark Eco

* Slower buildup than Green Eco
* Might require killing monsters to add to charge
* Relic keeps track of eco amount
* Requires a card to activate Dark Jak form
* Decreases all damage by half
* Can't use guns, jet board, or zoomers
* Can't use when on a jet board or zoomer
* Puts gun away/removes gun when activated
* Has very powerful attacks, might require combos
* Stops other Eco gain
* Clears other Eco out (except amount in relic)

## Light Eco

* Slower buildup than Green Eco
* Might require killing monsters to add to charge
* Relic keeps track of eco amount
* Requires a card to activate Light Jak form
* Can't use jet board, or zoomers
* Can't use when on a jet board or zoomer
* Using guns drains Light Eco per attack
* Mostly defensive in nature
* Might be able to heal
* Stops other Eco gain
