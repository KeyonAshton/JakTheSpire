# Eco

There are 6 types of Eco:
* Blue
* Green
* Red
* Yellow
* Dark
* Light

Eco will be found in 2 types:
* Orb/cluster form, some way for repeatable gain in high bursts
  * I don't know if I only want to allow 1 eco at a time, like TPL
  * Allowing multiple at a time makes simpler coding and simpler for the player
* Vent form, a continuous gain across turns in low amounts
  * You can only be on 1 vent at a time
  * Balancing will determine if getting off a vent refunds the old vent, or if it's gone for the rest of combat

* Can heal 1/16th of health.

* Only 1 card (starter), maybe 1 additional card can give green eco.
* Starter card has 3 upgrades:
  * Base gives 3 eco
  * First upgrade gives 5 eco

  * Last turns it into a vent, providing a continuous stream of 2 per turn.
