## The Sidekick

The Sidekick is Jak, but a few of his cards will have names as if Daxter was telling him what to do.
I wanted to make a reference to the end of Jak 3 when Daxter says next adventure he calls the shots.
The name comes from Daxter calling Jak the sidekick multiple times starting from when Kor says "I am happy to say that you and your sidekick are causing quite a stir in our fight against the Baron." and Daxter replies with "You hear that, Jak? You're the sidekick!"
There's also a line from Jak 3 with one of the soldiers "This ain't no place for a rat and his boy" implying that the rat is in control, not the boy.

The Sidekick's deck will have multiple things a player can focus on:
* Colored Eco
  * Blue eco will give energy per stack
  * Red eco will act like temporary strength, but decreases by 1 per turn
  * Yellow eco will do an extra hit on Attack played that deals piercing damage and removes stacks of metalicize
  * Green eco needs its own bullets:
    * Can stack up to 50 (balancing will decide)
    * Maintains stacks through floors
    * At max stacks, heals for 1/16 health
    * Can not heal if health is above 15/16
* Combos
  * Some cards will be able to be combod on each other
  * The combo cards dynamically updating in the player's hand as cards are played
  * There are some combos that work with basegame cards
    * If I learn how to make patches, I plan on adding in compatibility to other mods that have similar cards
* Ridables
  * Mainly used for defense
  * The list of ridables are:
    * A-Grav Zoomer (negates some statuses, low defense, low health, blows up)
    * Zoomer Bike (high defense, low health, blows up)
    * Zoomer Car (moderate defense, moderate health, blows up)
    * Krimzan Bike (high defense, low health, low damage up, blows up)
    * Krimzan Tank (moderate defense, high health, very low damage up, blows up)
    * Jet Board (high defense, 0 health, no Morph Gun, tiny dmg increase on first hit taken)
    * Flut Flut (low defense, low health, moderate attack up)
